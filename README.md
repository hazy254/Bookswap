#Bookswap

This is an Android application built in 2016 as part of the final project for an Android app development class.
The app allows users to swap any books currently located within their persona libraries with other users.
The communication between users was achieved via a simple text message function.
All server side data was hosted by the school but was deleted as of August 2017.
Future plans include allowing for multiple user registration (A static function as at now), in-app chat functionality, settings, better user authentication including encrypted passwords, UI fixes to conform with Material Design, user profiles and performance improvements.
